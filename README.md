# AddRoutes
A Blender Add-on allowing MIDI, OSC and a remote Android App to control Blender 4.2 created by JPfeP.
I've just updated it to work with Blender 4.2. Tested on MacOs with Apple Silicone.

Will make a PR to have this merged into the main repo then maybe register it to work with the new Blender add-on registry.
Until then you can download as a zip and install in blender from file.

For earlier versions of Blender see:
If you are a user, see the Download section here to get a ready-to-go file : http://www.jpfep.net/pages/addroutes/

If you want to participate to the development, theses sources files need some additionnal libraries to function properly, consequently you have to install them on your system :


    Python-RTMIDI: http://trac.chrisarndt.de/code/wiki/python-rtmidi
    MIDO : https://github.com/mido/mido
    OSCPY: https://github.com/kivy/oscpy
